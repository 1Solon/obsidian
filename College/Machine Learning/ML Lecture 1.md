## Machine Learning - Overview
- Topics covered include Supervised Learning, Classification, Dimensionality Reduction, The ML Process, Evaluation, Working with Text, and Unsupervised Learning.

---

## Relevance of ML
- The significant explosion in data, advancements in algorithms, computational power, and industry demand underscore the growing relevance of Machine Learning across various disciplines.

---

## Advances in AI
- Highlights include Dall-E for image generation from descriptions and ChatGPT for conversational interactions.

---

## But...
- Limitations of current AI technologies, including the lack of "understanding" by models like ChatGPT and examples of AI failures.

---

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
- Explained the differences between Supervised Learning (learning with labeled examples) and Unsupervised Learning (finding structure in data without labels).

---

## Representing Data
- Discusses how data is represented in Machine Learning, including different types of features like binary, categorical, ordinal, interval, and continuous.

---

## Classification Task
- A practical example of a classification task involving credit scoring is detailed, showing how a model is trained to classify customers into high-risk and low-risk categories.
