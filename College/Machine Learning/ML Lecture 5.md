## Overview
This lecture covers the error-based approach to learning, highlighting methods like Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). It includes an in-depth look at how models are iteratively refined to minimize error and predict outcomes accurately.

## Big Idea
Error-based learning models start with a parameterized prediction model and iteratively adjust its parameters to minimize error, akin to human learning processes such as mastering a new sport.

---

## Simple Linear Regression
- **Goal**: Predict a continuous outcome (e.g., office rental price) from one or more predictors.
- **Model**: Uses a linear equation to model the relationship between predictors and the outcome.
- **Optimization**: The optimal model parameters (weights) are found by minimizing the difference (error) between predicted and actual values.

---

## Measuring Error
- **Error Function**: Quantifies the accuracy of predictions, with the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) being a common choice.
- **Objective**: Minimize the error function across the training dataset to improve model predictions.

---

## Multivariate Linear Regression
- Extends simple regression to include multiple predictors, enhancing model complexity and predictive power.

---

## Gradient Descent
- An optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model parameters to find the minimum of the error function.
- Moves in the direction of the steepest decrease in error, akin to descending a hill in the least number of steps.

---

## Logistic Regression and SVMs
- **Logistic Regression**: Models binary outcomes by passing the linear regression output through a logistic function, interpreting results as probabilities.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in feature space, maximizing the margin between classes.

---

## Key Points
- **Regression**: Models the relationship between variables to predict continuous outcomes.
- **Gradient Descent**: An efficient method for finding the minimum of the error function, essential for training many types of machine learning models.
- **Logistic Regression**: Useful for binary classification tasks, outputs probabilities.
- **SVM**: Effective for both linear and non-linear classification through the use of kernel functions.

---

## Practical Applications
- **Regression**: Real estate pricing, stock market forecasting.
- **Logistic Regression**: Email spam detection, disease diagnosis.
- **SVM**: Image classification, text categorization.

## Further Exploration
- The interplay between model complexity (number of predictors) and overfitting.
- The role of regularization in managing model complexity and preventing overfitting.
