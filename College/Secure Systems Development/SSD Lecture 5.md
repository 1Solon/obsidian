## Overview
---
This lecture covers key aspects of software vulnerabilities, focusing on memory regions and input validation attacks.

### Memory Regions
---
- **Call Stack**: Involves the call stack mechanism in programming, discussing elements like shellcode, return pointers, and stack protectors.
- **Heap**: Although heap attacks lack a return address, they are still feasible. Understanding chunk headers is crucial to bypassing segmentation faults.
- **Data Segment**: Key for global and static variables.
- **Text Segment**: Generally read-only but can be exploited knowing addresses of certain functions.
- **Read-Only Data (rodata)**: Important for constants and literal strings.

### Input Validation Attacks
---
- **SQL Injection**: Exploits vulnerabilities in the database layer.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Targets scripts embedded in web pages.
- **Format String Exploits**: Utilizes format string vulnerabilities in C/C++.
- **Directory Traversal Attacks**: Involves accessing files outside the intended directory.

### Case Study: Heartbleed Bug
---
- Discovered in OpenSSL in 2014, introduced in 2012.
- Illustrates potential for zero-day exploits.
- Heartbeat message structure in TLS/SSL includes type, payload length, and padding.
- Heartbleed vulnerability allows reading memory contents of a server or a client.
