- High-level languages, despite their abstraction, are susceptible to various attacks.

- **Common Attacks**:
	  - Input validation attacks (SQL injection, XSS, format string exploits, directory traversal).
	  - Supply chain attacks, exacerbated by modern package managers.

- **Notable Vulnerabilities**:
	  - CVE-2023-27043: Unresolved email parsing exploit in Python.

- **Supply Chain Attacks Examples**:
	  - eslint-scope (2018), German companies simulation (2022), Node-IPC (2022), attack on crypto industry (2023), PyTorch torchtriton (2022).

- **Preventive Measures**:
	  - Stay informed on security updates.
	  - Regularly update software and dependencies.
	  - Monitor CVEs related to your technology stack.

- **Case Study**: Log4Shell, a significant vulnerability in Java's Log4j library, underscores the critical nature of security vigilance.
