* Von Neumann  
	– Allows instructions and data to be mixed and stored in the same memory module  
	– More flexible and easier to implement  
	– Suitable for most of the general purpose processors

> * Model for designing and building computers, based on the following three characteristics: 1) The computer consists of four main sub-systems: * Memory * ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit) * Control Unit * Input/Output System (I/O) 2) Program is stored in memory during execution. 3) Program instructions are executed sequentially.
