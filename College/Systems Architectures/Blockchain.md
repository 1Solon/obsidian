## Distributed Ledger
---
- A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies. 
- It allows transactions to have public "witnesses," thereby making a cyberattack more difficult.
- The participants at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it.
- Any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants in a matter of seconds or minutes.

## Proof of Work (PoW)
---
- Proof of Work is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving an arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody from gaming the system.
- It is used to validate transactions and mine new blocks to the chain.
- PoW requires a vast amount of computational power, which makes it costly and time-consuming to produce new blocks.
- This mechanism helps to deter malicious activities by making it impractical to manipulate the blockchain.

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network
---
- In a [[P2P]] network, each peer in the network has equal power and can perform the same tasks.
- It is used for sharing resources like files or providing direct services between systems in a blockchain network.
- This decentralized nature of [[P2P]] networks increases security, as there is no single point of failure.
- [[P2P]] is integral to blockchain as it ensures the distribution of data across a network of computers without requiring a central management system.

## Genesis Block
---
- The Genesis Block is the first block of a blockchain.
- Modern versions of Bitcoin number it as block 0, though very early versions counted it as block 1.
- It is hardcoded into the software of the applications that utilize its blockchain.
- The Genesis Block forms the foundation of any blockchain-based system and is often treated with a symbolic significance due to its role in initiating the blockchain.

## Blocks in Blockchain
---
- Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions.
- Every block has a unique code called a hash, and each new block contains the hash of the previous one, creating a linked chain.
- Blocks are secured by cryptographic principles.
- The first block that follows the genesis block is typically referred to as Block 1.

## Consensus Mechanism
---
- Consensus mechanisms are protocols that make sure all nodes are synchronized with each other and agree on which transactions are legitimate and are added to the block.
- They are essential for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the blockchain.
- Popular consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).
- These mechanisms also play a crucial role in how new blocks are created and how conflicts are resolved in a blockchain network.
