> Processes Continued * Typically system has many processes running concurrently on one or more CPUs * Processes can be whole i.e. single threaded or made up of different parts i.e. multi threaded. * Processes ,both system and user, compete for access to the CPU The CPU is timeshared amongst them according to some scheduling policy * Processes running on the CPU may be Interrupted.
