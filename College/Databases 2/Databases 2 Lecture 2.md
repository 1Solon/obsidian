**General Notes:**
* Inserting with one element returns null on all other elements in a row, or will fail depending on configuration
* "Select" returns data based on parameters e.g "SELECT x FROM y"
* Aggregates allow you to gather specific data from an SQL schema, for example the "count" command will return a number based on what you specificed
* Other examples are 'group by'(https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp) and 'having' (https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp)
* [[SQL Sub-Queries]]
