* Links back to [[Scientific Research & Literature Lecture 2]]

* Benchmarking, Surveys, Automatic Testing <- (Discussion on assignment 1)

* Not interested in Epistemology Anackonlgy? (Unsure of spelling, safe to ignore any 'ology')

* [[Inductive]] and [[Deductive]] <- Experiment is Deductive, etc

* 'Need to identify for each paper, what is the purpose, what is the methodology (how does it address that question), research onion, techniques'

* "Experiments can be both [[Qualitative and Quantitative]]"

* "Experiments are typically [[Deductive]]" (Same statement as above, tends to repeat? Useful)

* "[[REALISM]] relies on the idea of independence"

* [[INTERPRETIVISM]]

* [[OBJECTIVISM]] -> "Facts exist are real, they can be identified, testing. Expert systems are expert system in nature, knowledge base, code information explicitly into the knowledge base"

* [[EPISTEMOLOGY]] -> "Difference between real and fake"

* [[ONTOLOGY]] -> "Associations and relationships between things"

* [[What is a Literature Review]]

* "Start with identifying what it is you want to do, then ask questions and identify methods to answer those questions"

* "Is there a gap, is there an inadequacy" - Identify in past papers or problems that exist, and then exploit them - "They got 89% I got 90%, why is that, identify the difference"

* "Use terms in ways that others in the literature are using them, make sure to define concepts that you introduce"

* (Grumble, Grumble. I really don't like how he shifts between rhetorical and actual questions)
