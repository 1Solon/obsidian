**Flowcharts**

* A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm.

* Flowcharts are drawn using certain special-purpose symbols, such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals and small circles; 

* These symbols are connected by arrows called flowlines, which indicate the order in which the actions of the algorithm execute
