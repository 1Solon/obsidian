Philosophies > EPISTEMOLOGY > Epistemology is concerned with addressing the facts by asking for a definition of what is acceptable knowledge in a field of research and what information is known to be true due to rigorous testing and treated as fact. > This philosophy is most commonly used in “hard” scientific research as it searches for facts and information that can be proved without doubt rather than changeable situations and opinions.
