**General Notes:**
* [[Javascript Arrays]] use **numbered indexes**

* [[Javascript Objects]] use **named indexes**
	* Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.

**When to use Arrays? When to use Objects?**
* JavaScript does not support associative arrays (maps, dictionaries).

* You should use **objects** when you want the element names to be **strings (text).**

* You should use **arrays** when you want the element names to be **numbers**.
