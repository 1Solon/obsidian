* Why is a well-designed architecture important?
* If everything is modular and well organized, itâ€™s easier for teams to keep working with it the application (refactor a feature, extend the functionality, test its performance, etc.) and ensure a high-quality result. 
* QUALITY and SCALABILITY 
* A well architected solution should abstract services/functionality that can be easily replaced, without having to refactor the full codebase. Design patterns and principles can help us achieve this.
