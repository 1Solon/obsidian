**General Notes:**
* You can create encrypted file systems on AWS so that all your data and metadata is encrypted at rest by using the open standard AdvancedEncryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption algorithm. When you use AWS KMS, encryption and decryption arehandled automatically and transparently, so thatyou do not need to modify your applications. If your organization is subject to corporate or regulatory policies that require encryption of data and metadata at rest, AWS recommends  enabling encryption on all services that store your data. You can encrypt data stored in any service that is supported by AWS KMS.
