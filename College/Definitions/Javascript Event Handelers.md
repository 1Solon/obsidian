**General Notes:
* An event handler is a predefined JavaScript property of an object (in most cases an element in the document) that is used to handle an event on a Web page.

* An event is something that happens when the viewer performs some sort of action, such as clicking a mouse button, moving the mouse over a link, etc.

* *A page loading or other similar actions are also events*

* JavaScript event handlers identify when events occur and allow
you to perform specific tasks, making pages interactive and more
useful.
