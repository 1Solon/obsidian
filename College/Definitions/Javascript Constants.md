**General Notes:**
* Constants are typed, immutable values that, once initialised, cannot be changed

* Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are declared in.

* You are encouraged to use constants whenever possible to aid your codeâ€™s readability and to protect from accidental value overwriting
