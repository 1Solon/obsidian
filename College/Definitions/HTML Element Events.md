**General Notes:**
* To use an event handler, you can add it as an additional attribute to an HTML tag.

* The only difference between an event handler “attribute” and an HTML attribute is that **you can add JavaScript code inside an event handler attribute** rather than just an attribute value:

* Notice that the alert command ends with a semicolon.

* This enables you to add additional JavaScript code after the alert, to perform multiple actions on the click event.

* If the code you want to use becomes really long, you may wish to put the code in a function instead.

* That function can be in an external file as well.
