* Instance types vary in several ways, including: CPU type, CPU or core count, storage type, storage amount, memory amount, and network performance.The chart provides a high-level view of the different instance categories, and which instance type families and generation numbersfit into each category type. Consider a few of the instance types in more detail:
	* T3 instances provideburstable performance general purposeinstances that provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline. Use cases for this type of instance include websites and web applications, development environments, build servers, code repositories, microservices, test and staging environments, and line-of-business applications.
	
	* C5instances are optimized for compute-intensiveworkloads, and deliver cost-effective high performance at a low price per compute ratio.Use cases includescientific modeling, batch processing, ad serving, highly scalable multiplayer gaming, and video encoding.
	
	* R5instances are optimized for memory-intensive applications. Usecases include high-performance databases, data mining and analysis, in-memory databases, distributed web-scale in-memory caches, applications that perform real-time processing of unstructured big data, Apache Hadoopor Apache Spark clusters, and other enterprise applications.
