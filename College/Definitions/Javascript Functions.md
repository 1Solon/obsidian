**General Notes:**
* Functions are a very important and heavilyused language feature in JS

* Functions are first-class datatypes which means that they can be:
	* Assigned as values to constants and variables 
	* Passed as arguments to other functions  
	* Return as values from other functions

* JS functions can also be defined recursively

* There are two syntaxes for declaring a function

**Functions as Values:**
 * A function declaration is a value that can be assigned and used later

 **Functions as Function Arguments:**
 * Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions

* In the following example, the Array.forEach function is passed a function which will be called for every element (n) in the array

* Note the use of the inline shorthand function constructor syntax below:
