The scientific method of inquiry is characterized by the following convictions:

* that the process must be **objective** to reduce bias in methods and interpretation of results.

* hat the process should be **systematic** in that it ought to involve certain standard procedures.

* enquiry should be conducted through a process of systematic observation that can be verified by experience (**empiricism**).

* There should be careful recording, documenting, archival and sharing of all data and methodology (**full disclosure**) to make it available for scrutiny by other researchers, thereby allowing them to verify results by attempting to reproduce them.
