**General Notes:**
* Android is an open-source operative system based on Linux and Java for smartphones (Sony Xperia, Samsung Galaxy) and tablets. It is also used for watches and cars.

*  Android was developed by the Open Handset Alliance which is lead by Google. Why do you think google did that? A free OS for phones? 

*  The first Android Software Development Kit (SDK) was released in 2007. Google released Jelly Bean in 2012 with the idea of improving the user interface. Why google created the SDK for free? 

*  Android is designed as a unique platform in the sense that developers only need to code their application in Android and it will run on any device.
