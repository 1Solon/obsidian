**Mobile Interaction Design Patterns**
* Vertical stack 
* Generous borders 
* Thumbnail-and-text lists 
* Loading indicators 
* Filmstrip (swipe navigation) 
* Touch tools (show after touch) 
* Infinite list (append more) 
* Text clear button

**Image example:**

* Clear Text Button (Erase all text in a box)

## From other notes:

> For EASY USE: * Optimize the most common interaction sequences * Eliminate or reduce typing . e.g. type = email on forms, a mobile browser will add ‘@’ “.com’ on main keyboard . hints and auto-complete (AJAX, browser cache...) * Reduce the number of taps . reduce the number of steps to complete tasks

> For NETWORK DATA OPTIMIZATION: * Use as few page loads as possible (AJAX...) « Use lightweight protocols if possible (REST...) For PAGE LOAD SPEED: « Consider JS library choices (size, server-side rendering...) * W3.CSS versus Bootstrap? * React versus Angular?

## What do mobile users actually need?

* Users with a mobile device may only want to use your web app in particular ways, they won't have the same range of needs that user of the full website will/should have.

Design for use context such as:
* "I need to know something **quickly**."
* "I need to do something **right now**."
* "What's relevant to the **place I'm in** at the moment?"

**RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW**
