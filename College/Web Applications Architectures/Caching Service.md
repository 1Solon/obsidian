Caching services are used to save the results of expensive and repetitive computations. This makes it possible to retrieve them from cache, instead of recomputing these results every time they are needed.

* Examples:
	* Databases Queries
	* Calls to External Services
	* HTML responses for specific URLs

* Examples of caching services:
	* [[Redis]]
	* [[Memcache]]
