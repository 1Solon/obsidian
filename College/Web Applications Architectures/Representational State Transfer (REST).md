## Definition

**REST**, or **Representational State Transfer**, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.

## Key Principles

- **Client-Server Architecture**: A separation of concerns is the underlying principle of REST. The client and the server are independent of each other, allowing each to evolve separately.
- **Statelessness**: Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and complete the request. The server does not store any state about the client session.
- **Cacheable**: Resources should be cacheable to improve performance. The server must define which resources are cacheable and for how long.
- **Uniform Interface**: A uniform interface simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently.
- **Layered System**: A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way.
- **Code on Demand (optional)**: Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring executable code.

## Components

- **Resource**: Anything that can be named, a document or image, a temporal service (e.g. "today's weather in Los Angeles"), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on.
- **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: A resource is identified by a URI, which is a unique identifier.
- **HTTP Methods**: REST uses a set of standard HTTP methods, including:
  - **GET** (read a resource)
  - **POST** (create a new resource)
  - **PUT** (update an existing resource)
  - **DELETE** (remove a resource)

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Due to its stateless nature, REST can handle large numbers of requests.
- **Flexibility**: Allows different types of data formats.
- **Portability**: With a standardized interface, the client and the server can be written in different languages.
- **Visibility**: Communication between client and server is done over HTTP, where interactions are completely visible.

## Use Cases

- **Web Services**: APIs that adhere to REST architectural constraints are called RESTful APIs.
- **Cloud Solutions**: Facilitates communication between client and server in cloud services.
- **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Used for building web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable, which is essential for IoT applications.
