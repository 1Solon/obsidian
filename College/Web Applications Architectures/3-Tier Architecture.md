## Definition from other notes:
* A 3-tier application architecture is a modular client-server architecture that consists of a  presentation tier, an application tier and a data tier.  
* 
* The data tier stores information, the application tier handles logic and the presentation tier is a graphical user interface (GUI).  

* The three tiers are logical and may or may not run on the same physical server.  

* Physically separating the tiers improves scalability and resiliency, but also adds latency from the additional network communication.
