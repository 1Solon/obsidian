Classification of research can be based on different considerations.

1. The nature of the dominant data (qualitative or quantitative)

3. The purpose of the research (applied or basic)

5. The type of analysis that will be carried out (descriptive or analytical)

The three basic types of research are:
* [[Qualitative and Quantitative]]

* [[Basic and Applied]]

* [[Descriptive and Analytical]]
