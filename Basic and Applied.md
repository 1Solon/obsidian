- Basic research (also called fundamental or pure research) is mainly concerned with generalizations and the formulation of theory.

-  Basic Research focusses on very specific problems for example the boiling point of a liquid or the stress tolerance on metallic products

- Applied research is designed to solve practical problems of the society. It can be argued that the goal of applied research is to improve the human condition.

- An example of Applied Research might be the impact of early school leaving on job prospects

#### Action Research  
* Action research is a unique form of applied   research. It is a reflective process of progressive problem solving.  

* Also called "practitioner research" because of the involvement of the actual practitioner in real life.

* Action implies that the practitioner is involved in the collection of data, analysis, and the  interpretation of results.

* The researcher is also involved in implementing results of the research and is thus well placed  to judge the effectiveness of the interventions.
