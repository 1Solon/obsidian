> INDUCTIVE * Inductive means that you are researching to Create theory. > The process moves in the opposite direction to the deductive approach, where the focus is not the existing theory. » This means the research goes from research question to observation and description, to analysis and finally theory. > Therefore if little research exists on a topic then an inductive approach may be the best way to proceed.
