*  Designed for resilience
* Released in 2017, former google staff
* Strongly consistent, scalability, fault tolerance
* Scalability is handled by horizontal scaling
* Very fast to scale nodes
* Consistency is handled by a consensus algorithm called "raft"
* "Makes sure consistency, rebalance nodes if failure (replica)"
* Offers automatic shading and rebalancing
* Latency are based on "sysbench" by "tpc"
* "Secondary indexes by standard"
* "Robust monitoring features- dashboard"
* "If outage, cluster-log will be sent"
* "Node map is a visualisation of multi-region nodes"
* Highly scalable, high availability
* Two big releases every year
* Open source? (seems to be on Git)
* Deployable on all cloud services
* Started development 10 years ago in 2014
* Can be run locally, not just cloud service
* By default it takes five minutes to determine if a cluster is dead
* Serverless, cannot create nodes
* Dedicated, create nodes, not as fast
* Don't support triggers
* Only partial support for SQL standards
