For example after an update operation all clients see the same data. = All nodes show the same data at the same time = Availability (every request receives a response about whether it succeeded or failed) ® This means that the system is always on (service guarantee availability), no downtime. * Node failure does not stop other nodes = Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures) = this means that the system continues to function even when the communication among the servers is unreliable, i.e. the servers may be partitioned into multiple groups that cannot communicate with one another. = Arbitrary loss of messages does not cause failure (e.g. network failure) = Theoretically : Only 2 of the 3 are possible. = For NoSQL consistency is sacrificed","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
