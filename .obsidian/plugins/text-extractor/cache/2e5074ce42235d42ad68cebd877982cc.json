Enhanced performance through load distributing. * Inherent distribution: Some applications are inherently distributed. Ex. a supermarket chain. * Reliability: If one machine crashes, the system as a whole can still survive. Higher availability and improved reliability. * Incremental growth: Computing power can be added in small increments. Modular expandability","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
