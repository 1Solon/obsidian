For each CIDR block that you specify, AWS reserves five IP addresses within that block, and these addresses are not available for use. AWS reserves these IP addresses for: * Network address * VPC local router (internal communications) * Domain Name System (DNS) resolution * Future use * Network broadcast address For example, suppose that you create a subnet with an IPv4 CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/24 (which has 256 total IP addresses). The subnet has 256 IP addresses, but only 251 are available because five are reserved.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
