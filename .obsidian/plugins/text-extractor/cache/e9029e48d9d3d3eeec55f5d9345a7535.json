On extra small screens, it will automatically stack. The classes can be combined to adjust the layout to better suit each screen size: <div class=\"col-sm-7 col-md-6 col-Ig-8\"> content </div> <div class=\"col-sm-5 col-md-6 col-Ig-4\"> content </div> On small devices it will divide the content in two columns, one with 7/12 of the width, the other with 5/12 of the width. On medium devices, itâ€™s a 50/50 split; On large devices it will be 2/3 vs 1/3 split.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
