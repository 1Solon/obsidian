Each Controller function is triggered by the userâ€™s interaction with the View. v The Controller collects information, passes it on to the Model to be organized for storage, and does not contain any logic other than that needed to collect the input. v The Controller is also only connected to a single View and to a single Model, making it a one way data flow system, with handshakes and signoffs at each point of data exchange. v A common mistake by developers in applying the MVC pattern is to assign the Controller with responsibilities that the View should have, like the crunching and processing of data from the Model to the View.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
