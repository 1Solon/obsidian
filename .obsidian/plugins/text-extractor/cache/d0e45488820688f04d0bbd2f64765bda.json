DyBLII » A native app is a computer program that has been specifically designed for a particular user environment, e.g. mobile apps, which are developed using specific programming code. » Unlike web apps, native or mobile apps are downloaded by the user to their mobile device, usually through app stores. Native apps can only be accessed on the device they have been installed on, and users are responsible for accessing any updates. » Developers must build different versions of mobile applications if they want to make them available across operating systems like iOS or Android, to ensure they have as broad a reach as possible. » Developers must also ensure their mobile apps adhere to app store standards or risk having their apps rejected.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
