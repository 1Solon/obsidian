Regular files are required to have the following attributes: * The length of the file in bytes. * Device ID (this identifies the device containing the file). * The User ID of the file's owner. * The Group ID of the file. * Aninode number that identifies the file within the filesystem. * The file mode, which determines what users can read, write, and execute the file. * Timestamps telling when the inode itself was last changed (ctime), the file content last modified (mtime), and last accessed (atime). * A reference count telling how many hard links point to the inode","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
