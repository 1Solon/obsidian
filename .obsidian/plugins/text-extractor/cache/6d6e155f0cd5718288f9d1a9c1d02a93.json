The UNIX file system might also be envisioned as an inverted tree or the root system of plant. * At the very top of the file system is single directory called \"root\" which is represented by a / (slash). All other files are \"descendents\" of root. * The number of levels is largely arbitrary, although most UNIX systems share some organizational similarities. |","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
