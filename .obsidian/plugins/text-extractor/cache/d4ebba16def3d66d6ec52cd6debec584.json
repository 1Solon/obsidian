An inode stores basic information about a regular file, directory, or other file system object. * When a file system is created, data structures that contain information about files are created. Each file has an inode and is identified by an inode number (i-number) in the file system where it resides. inodes store information on files such as user and group ownership, access mode (read, write, execute permissions) and type of file. There is a fixed number of inodes, which indicates the maximum number of files each filesystem can hold. * Afile's inode number can be found using the Is -i command, while the Is -l command will retrieve inode information","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
