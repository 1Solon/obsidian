Â» However, where they differ is that realism thinks that scientific methods are not perfect. > It believes that all theory can be revised and that our ability to know for certain what reality is may not exist without continually researching and leaving our minds open to using new methods of research. > Realism may therefore use several types of research methods to triangulate results in their search for a more reliable outcome.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
