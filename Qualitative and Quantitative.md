* Qualitative research deals with designs techniques and measure that do not produce discrete numerical data. It involves extensive narrative data in order to gains insights into phenomena. Data analysis includes the coding of the data and production of verbal synthesis (inductive process). Examples include historical research, ethnographic research, participant observational research and the case study.

* Quantitative research includes designs, techniques and measures that produce discrete numerical or quantifiable data. Data analysis is mainly statistical (deductive process). It is characterized by:
	* causal-comparative
	* correlational
	* experimental
	* descriptive research

## Qualitive v Quantitative
#### Quantitative Research Strategy  
* Aims to assess a pre-stated theory, typically using hypothesis testing (Deductive Reasoning)

* Tries to Avoid Researcher bias on the outcome

* Quantitative data facilitates statistics

* Data based on ‘closed’ responses

#### Qualitative Research Strategy
* Aims to create a novel theory (Inductive Reasoning)

* Not so worried about researcher bias. Indeed they often become an inherent part of the study ethnography
