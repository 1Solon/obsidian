* Characters can choose between several different kinds of action, depending on what they want to achieve. On their turn, characters can make a **standard move** and take either **two quick actions** or one **full action.** The same action cannot be taken more than once per turn, except in certain cases (e.g., special actions like **free actions** and **reactions**).

## Special Actions
---
* In addition to move, quick, and full actions, there are several types of special actions: **free actions**, **reactions**, and **OVERCHARGE**. Unlike the standard action types, there is **no limit** to how many free actions and reactions a character can take per round. Characters can even take reactions outside of their turn.

## Overcharge
---
* Pilots can overcharge their mech, allowing them to make an additional quick action at the cost of heat.
