> ACTION RESEARCH > This strategy is characterised as a problem-solving approach to a specific research problem within a community of practice. > As part of this search for a solution the strategy allows the researcher to be part of the organisation or case study that requires the solution. It allows for collaboration between the topic organisation and the researcher. Â» The process of Action Research moves from a clear objective to diagnosis of the problem and generation of a list of actions to solve the problem and establishing that it corresponds to the best approach. * It tends to involve reflective practice, which is a systematic process by which the professional practice and experience of the practitioners can be assessed.
