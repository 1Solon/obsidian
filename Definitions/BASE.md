> CAP Theorem = The BASE acronym was defined by Eric Brewer, who is also known for formulating the CAP theorem. = A BASE system gives up on consistency. = Basically Available indicates that the system does guarantee availability, in terms of the CAP theorem. = Soft state indicates that the state of the system may change over time, even without input. This is because of the eventual consistency model. (stuff happens) = Eventual consistency indicates that the system will become consistent over time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that time. = Rather than requiring consistency after every transaction, it is enough for the database to eventually be in a consistent state. o[ {e T TEY=INo ]y} and b BASE focuses on EN[e] and throws Consistency out the window.
