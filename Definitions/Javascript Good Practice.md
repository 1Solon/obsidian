**General Notes:**
* Use semicolons to separate JavaScript statements

* Add white space to your script to make it more readable.
	* put spaces around operators ( = + - * / )

* Avoid code lines longer than 80 characters
	* If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator

* Declare variables at the top of their scope (e.g., at the start of the script or a function) to provide clarity as to their scope (required with let).

* Initialise variables on declaration.

* Minimize the use of global variables
