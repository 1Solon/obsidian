**General Notes:**
* Javascript is a [[Dynamic Programming Language]]

* Originally only executed client-side, by the user's web browser
	* As opposed to server-side (on the web server)
	* Currently, [[Node.js]] (an open source server framework) allows you to run JavaScript on the server.

* Like many dynamic languages JavaScript is [[dynamically typed]].
	* At runtime, the system merely checks that a variable supports all of the operations performed on it.

* It quickly became popular and is now considered the language of the web
