**General Notes:**
* Objects are the most useful types in JS but they don’t work quite the same way as you might be familiar with in other languages

* At its most basic, an object is a data structure for holding key/value properties which can be primitive, other objects or even functions

* The most common way to create an object is to use the literal constructor syntax although we’ll see others later in the module
