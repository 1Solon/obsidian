> » The second argument we passed is the encoding, utf-8 in our case. 1nis ensures nat the file is read in the same way it was stored. » The readFile method is asynchronous and, hence, takes a completion callback as its last argument. + Since this is asynchronous, the process does not block and we see our Hello! before the file data. » The readFileSync method,as the name suggests, is synchronous. Unlike the asynchronous method, this blocks the program until the file is read. This is why we see the file data first, followed by the Hello!in our output.
