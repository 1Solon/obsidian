**Overview:**
* It is a platform that helps as to build computer applications
 
* It provides the necessary components to build tools that have a similar arquitectura 

* Generally the tools are for a similar porpose 

* Examples of frameworks: 
	* Node.js is used for online applications. 
	* Java RMI is used for distributed systems 
	* Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Keras are frameworks based on Python for machine learning 
	* Android Developer Studio is a framework to build apps on Android. 
	* GIMP and Photoshop are frameworks for picture editing

**Characteristics of a good framework:**
* Easy to use 

* Does not contain redundant functions 

* It is well documented 

* Uses the best practices in the past 

* The code is optimized 

* Allows reusable components 

* Easy to compile and debug

**Why use a framework?**
* It increases our productivity 

* People that has learnt that framework does not need to learn again 

* It allows focusing in the particularities of the project not the generic repetitive code
 
* Reduces costs 

* By using conventions the code is understandable by others

**Challenges of using a framework:**
* Some may not have all the funtionality

* They may not be the best solution for small applications 

* A vulnerability in a framework applies to all the aplications created on that framework

* The learning curve makes you not productive at the beginning of the process

* Senior people can be less willing to change into a new framework. Some people can be very reluctant.
