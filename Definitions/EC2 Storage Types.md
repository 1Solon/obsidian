* **Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)** is an easy-to-use, high-performance durable block storage service that is designed to be used with Amazon EC2 for both throughput-and transaction-intensive workloads. With Amazon EBS, you can choose from four different volume types to balance the optimal price and performance. You can change volume types or increase volume size without disrupting your critical applications, so you can have cost-effective storage when you need it.

* **Amazon EC2 Instance Store** provides ephemeral, or temporary, block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance Store works well when you must temporarily store information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content. You can also use Instance Store for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load balanced pool of web servers. If the instances are stopped—either because of user error or a malfunction—the data on the instance store will be deleted.

* **Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)** provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic Network File System (NFS) file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is built to scale on-demand to petabytes without disrupting applications. It grows and shrinks automatically as you add and remove files, which reduces the need to provision and manage capacity to accommodate growth.
