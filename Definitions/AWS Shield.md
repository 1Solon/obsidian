* **AWS Shield** is a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. It provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. AWS Shield Advanced is available to all customers. However, to contact the DDoS Response Team, customers must have either Enterprise Support or Business Support from AWS Support.
