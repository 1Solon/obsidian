**Philosophy: “write code once, run anywhere”**
* Java is compiled using the Javac compiler. 
* Javac converts the java code into bytecode 
* The bytecode can be executed on any java virtual machine so it is portable.

**Platform Independence:**
* The main advantage of Java is that it provides platform independence. 
* Any program in Java can be executed in any machine in the world.
* Java is able to do that by introducing an intermediate code called BYTE code. 
* It is different from other languages such as C or C++ which translate into machine code.
