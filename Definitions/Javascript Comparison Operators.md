**General Notes:**
* **Inequality operator !=,** the interpreter implicitly tries to convert the values to an appropriate type before comparing.

* **Non-identity or strict inequality operator !==,** does not convert values when comparing. Only true if the operands are not of the same type and the contents do not match.
