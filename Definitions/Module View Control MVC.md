**Overview:**
* The MVC pattern in modern web development can be easily explained by ordering a drink from a bartender.

	* In a bar, you approach the bartender, and shout out an order for a Manhattan, your favourite drink. You are the **user**, and your drink order is the **user request. **
	
	* The bartender gives you a quick nod. The bartender’s brain is the **controller**. He/she immediately thinks of the series of steps needed to complete your drink order. 
	
		1. Grab glass 
		2. Add whiskey 
		3. Add vermouth 
		4. Add bitters 
		5. Stir drink 
		6. Add cherry 
		7. Ask for and process payment

	* The bartender can only use the tools and resources that are behind the bar. This limited tool set is the **model**, and includes the following which may vary from one bar to another:  
		* The bartender’s hands 
		* Shakers / mixing equipment 
		* Liquors 
		* Mixes 
		* Glasses 
		* Garnishes

	* Finally, the finished drink is the **view**. 
	* It is built out of the limited options from the model, and arranged and transmitted via the controller (i.e., the bartender’s brain).
