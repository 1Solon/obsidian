**Genera Notes:**
* Data encryption is an essential tool to usewhen your objective is to protect digital data. Data encryption takes data that is legible and encodes it so that it is unreadable to anyone who does not have access to the secret key that can be used to decode it. Thus, even if an attacker gains access to your data, they cannot make sense of it.

* Data at rest refers to data that is physically stored on disk or on tape.
